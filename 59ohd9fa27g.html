<div>In the loop, calculate the mean for each sample, and store the sample mean values in a vector sample_mean. Plot the sample mean values for sample size k = 20 on a plot. Indicate the true mean. (Hint: you can use the function abline to plot a straight line at the true mean value.) Now create a function that calculates the standard deviation of the means of 1000 random samples of user-specifiable sample size k, drawn from a normal distribution of true mean m and true standard deviation s. sd_sample_mean </div><div></div><div>fd</div><div>df</div><div>fd</div><div></div>
