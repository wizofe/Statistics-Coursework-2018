<div>If we plot the data, we can observe that they don't fall in the case of a normal distribution.&nbsp;As the distribution of concentrations is skewed, the median could be a better measure of centrality than the mean. The distribution of the concentrations also has heavy tails so the median could be a more efficient estimator of centrality than the mean&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{peters}</cite>. Thus to&nbsp;determine if the deletion of the transcription factor changes the concentration of protein X present in the cell, we consider the median value of the concentration. The result of the plot is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{136140}</span>. We will also use the percentile bootstrap method&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Carpenter_2000}</cite> in order to determine the 95% confidence interval.</div>
