<div>If we plot the data we can observe that they don't fall in the case of a normal distribution.&nbsp;When the distribution of the response variable is skewed, the population median may be a more meaningful measure of centrality than the population mean, and when the population distribution of the response variable has heavy tails, the sample median may be a more efficient estimator of centrality than the sample mean In order to&nbsp;determine if the deletion of the transcription factor changes the concentration of protein X present in the cell, we consider the median value of the concentration. The result of the plot is shown in the Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{136140}</span></div><div></div>
