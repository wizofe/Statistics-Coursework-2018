<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a Welch two-sample t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions of populations are statistically different. The null hypothesis is:</div><div></div><ul><i>H0 : µ1 = µ2</i></ul><div>where</div><ul><li><i>μ1</i> is the mean expression for gene tc4 in ALL patients</li><li><i>μ2</i> is the mean expression for gene tc4 in AML patients</li></ul><div></div><div>Let's suppose that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{x}\)</span> is the mean of the gene expression data for the group ALL and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{y}\)</span> is the mean of the population AML, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s_2^1\)</span> the variance of the first and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s_2^2\)</span> that of the second, for {x<sub>1</sub>, · · ·,x<sub>n</sub>} and {y<sub>1</sub>, · · · ,y<sub>m</sub>} the data for ALL&nbsp;and AML respectively. Then the t-statistic can be formulated as:</div><div></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{(\overline{x}−\overline{y})−(\mu_1−\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n}+\frac{s_2^2}{m}}}\)</span></div><div></div><div>The decision procedure with respect to the null-hypothesis is now completely similar to the above t-test. Note that the t-value is large if the difference between x and y is large and the standard deviations s1 and s2 are small. We assume that the distribution of both data sets must be normal, to assess if the gene is differentially expressed between the two groups, with α (significant level) equal to 5% (α = 0.05).&nbsp;The test can be run in the same environment&nbsp;as the previous R code by using the library function,&nbsp;<code>t.test()</code>,&nbsp;with the parameter<code>var.equal = FALSE
</code>which calculates the Welch two-sample test:</div>
