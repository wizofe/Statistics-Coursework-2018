<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a Welch two-sample t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions of populations are statistically different. The null hypothesis is if that the gene expression levels are the same between ALL versus AML patients. Specifically, if we suppose that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{x}\)</span> is the mean of the gene expression data for the group ALL and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{y}\)</span> is the mean of the population AML, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s_2^1\)</span> the variance of the first and <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s_2^2\)</span> that of the second. </div><div></div><div></div><ul><i>H<sub>0</sub> : µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub></i></ul>
