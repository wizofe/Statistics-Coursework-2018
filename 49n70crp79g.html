<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a Welch two-sample t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions of populations are statistically different. The null hypothesis is if that the gene expression levels are the same between ALL versus AML patients. Specifically, if we suppose that x, and s 2 1 the variance of the first and s 2 2 that of the second. Then the t-statistic can be formulated as t = (x − y) − (µ1 − µ2) p s 2 1 /n + s 2 2 /m . (4.2) The decision procedure with respect to the null-hypothesis is now completely similar to the above t-test. Note that the t-value is large if the difference between x and y is large and the standard deviations s1 and s2 are small.&nbsp;</div><div></div><ul><i>H<sub>0</sub> : µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub></i></ul>
