<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a two sample (unpaired) t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions are statistically different. The null hypothesis is to test if that the gene expression levels are the same between ALL versus AML patients, or:</div><div></div><div>If we suppose that gene expression data from the first group are given by {x<sub>1</sub>, · · · xn} and that of the second by {y1, · · · , ym}. Let x be the mean of the first and y that of the second, and s 2 1 the variance of the first and s 2 2 that of the second. Then the t-statistic can be formulated as t = (x − y) − (µ1 − µ2) p s 2 1 /n + s 2 2 /m . (4.2) The decision procedure with respect to the null-hypothesis is now completely similar to the above t-test. Note that the t-value is large if the difference between x and y is large and the standard deviations s1 and s2 are small. This test is known as the Welch two-sample t-test (Lehmann, 1999).</div><div></div><ul><i>H<sub>0</sub> : µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub></i></ul>
