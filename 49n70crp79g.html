<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a two sample (unpaired) t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions are statistically different. The null hypothesis is to test if that the gene expression levels are the same between ALL versus AML patients, or:</div><div></div><ul><i>H<sub>0</sub> : µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub></i></ul>
