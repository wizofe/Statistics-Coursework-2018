<div>The above R program generates the boxplot shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. There is a difference in gene expression values of the Tc4 in ALL versus AML patients as shown inFig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{935989}</span>. In order to test the null hypothesis, we can apply a two sample (unpaired) t-test to determine whether the means of two gene expressions are statistically different. The null hypothesis is that the gene</div><div></div><ul><i>H0: tc4,ALL&nbsp;= tc4,AML</i></ul>
