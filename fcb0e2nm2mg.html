<div>The decision procedure concerning the null-hypothesis is now entirely similar for the above t-test. Note that the t-value is large if the difference between x and y is significant and the standard deviations s1 and s2 are small. We assume that the distribution of both data sets must be normal, to assess if the gene is differentially expressed between the two groups, with α (significant level) equal to 5% (α = 0.05) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{krijnen}</cite>. The test can be run in the same environment&nbsp;as the previous R code by using the library function&nbsp;<code>t.test()</code>&nbsp;with the parameter&nbsp;<code>var.equal = FALSE
</code>&nbsp;which calculates the Welch two-sample test:</div>
